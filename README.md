# LessPane prototype

Instant window washing quotes and booking requests for lesspane.com.
SvelteKit (TypeScript, Svelte 5) running on Cloud Run, with Firestore for storage.

The quote is **one page with five things to play with**, each starting on a sensible choice so a price shows
before anyone touches anything. The price stays pinned at the top.

| Control | Gesture | Chooses | Starts at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| House card | swipe left/right | house type and stories (12 photos) | two-story modern farmhouse |
| Squeegee | pull the blade along the glass | number of windows (1–40) | 20 |
| Flip window | tap or flick to flip | outside only, or both sides | outside only |
| Stickers on a pane | peel off (drag or tap); tap the tray to undo | screens, tracks, hard water | none |
| Sun dial | tap a day, drag the sun across the sky | day, morning or afternoon | a few days out (not Sunday), morning |

Below them: address, name, phone, email, and a send button showing the price. A confirmation page follows,
plus a password-protected owner page at `/admin`.

## Run it locally

Requires Node 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then set ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm run dev               # http://localhost:5173
```

Locally, requests are saved to `.data/requests.json` and emails are printed to the terminal,
so you need no Google Cloud or email account to try the whole flow.

Other commands:

```bash
npm test          # pricing and validation unit tests (Vitest)
npm run check     # TypeScript and Svelte type check
npm run build     # production build into ./build
npm start         # run the production build (node build)
```

Commit `package-lock.json` after the first install.

## Where things live

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/config.ts` | **All business settings**: per-window rate, factors, add-ons, minimum, service-area ZIPs. Prices are market estimates; ZIPs are placeholders. |
| `src/lib/pricing.ts` | Quote formula: `max(minimum, round(windows × rate × story × service + add-ons))`; add-ons are per window or per visit |
| `src/lib/validation.ts` | Input checks shared by all screens |
| `src/lib/server/store.ts` | `quote_requests` storage: Firestore or local JSON file |
| `src/lib/server/email.ts` | Customer confirmation and owner alert via Resend |
| `src/hooks.server.ts` | Basic auth for `/admin`, security headers |
| `src/routes/` | The quote screen (`+page.svelte`), confirmation (`quote/thanks`) and `/admin` |
| `src/lib/components/` | The controls: `HouseCard` + `SwipeCard`, `Squeegee`, `FlipWindow`, `PeelPane`, `SunDial`; `GrimeDefs` (shared dirt effects), `Icon` |
| `src/lib/photos.ts`, `static/photos/` | House photos (1, 2, 3 stories), their window positions and credits |
| `static/manifest.webmanifest`, `static/icons/` | PWA manifest and icons (installable to home screen) |
| `Dockerfile`, `cloudbuild.yaml` | Container and Cloud Run deploy |
| `firestore.rules` | Denies all direct client access to Firestore |

Prices are always recomputed on the server; the browser never sends a price.

## Before the pilot

- [ ] Confirm the estimated prices against local competitor quotes, and set the service-area ZIP list, in `src/lib/config.ts`
- [ ] Replace placeholder copy on the price page (what's included, when payment is due)
- [ ] Set `OWNER_EMAIL`, and verify `lesspane.com` as a sending domain in Resend

## Deploy to Google Cloud

The app has its own Google Cloud project, **`lesspane`** (billed to the "primary" billing account).
One-time setup is already done:

| Resource | Value |
| --- | --- |
| APIs | Run, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Firestore, Secret Manager |
| Container registry | `us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/lesspane/lesspane` |
| Firestore | `(default)` (production) and `staging` databases, Native mode, `us-west1` |
| Secrets | `lesspane-admin-password`, `lesspane-staging-admin-password` (random; read them with the command below) |
| Runtime account | `lesspane-run@`: Cloud Datastore User; Secret Accessor on its own secrets only |
| Deployer account | `lesspane-build@`: Run Admin, Artifact Registry Writer, Log Writer, Storage Object Viewer, Service Account User on `lesspane-run` |
| GitHub | `eireford/lesspane`, linked through the Cloud Build connection `lesspane-github` |

Your gcloud default project may be a different one, so pass `--project lesspane` to every command.

### Staging and production

| | Staging | Production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Domain | https://lesspane.net | https://lesspane.com |
| Cloud Run service | `lesspane-staging` | `lesspane` |
| Firestore database | `staging` | `(default)` |
| Admin secret | `lesspane-staging-admin-password` | `lesspane-admin-password` |
| Deploys when | you push to `main` (trigger `lesspane-staging`) | you push a `v*` tag (trigger `lesspane-production`) |

Staging sends `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` so it stays out of search results.

Release to production after checking staging:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```

Set the owner alert address once per service (deploys keep it):

```bash
gcloud run services update lesspane --project lesspane --region us-west1 \
  --update-env-vars OWNER_EMAIL=you@example.com,EMAIL_FROM="LessPane <hello@lesspane.com>"
```

Admin password for the deployed `/admin` page (use `lesspane-staging-admin-password` for staging):

```bash
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret lesspane-admin-password --project lesspane
```

Emails are logged to Cloud Logging until Resend is set up. To turn them on:

```bash
printf 're_your_resend_key' | gcloud secrets create lesspane-resend-api-key --data-file=- --project lesspane
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding lesspane-resend-api-key --project lesspane \
  --member serviceAccount:lesspane-run@lesspane.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
```

then append `,RESEND_API_KEY=lesspane-resend-api-key:latest` to the `--update-secrets` line in `cloudbuild.yaml`.

Also: set a **billing budget with alerts** before sharing the link.

### Domains

Both domains are registered at Squarespace Domains, which also hosts their DNS. Each is mapped to its
Cloud Run service with Cloud Run domain mapping, which provides managed HTTPS certificates.
`www.` is mapped on both, too.

DNS records at Squarespace (same for both domains; the Squarespace default A and `www` records are removed):

| Host | Type | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@` | A | `216.239.32.21`, `216.239.34.21`, `216.239.36.21`, `216.239.38.21` |
| `@` | AAAA | `2001:4860:4802:32::15`, `2001:4860:4802:34::15`, `2001:4860:4802:36::15`, `2001:4860:4802:38::15` |
| `www` | CNAME | `ghs.googlehosted.com.` |
| `@` | TXT | `google-site-verification=…` (proves ownership to Google; keep it) |

## Photo credits

House photos are freely licensed images from Wikimedia Commons, listed with author, license and source link in
`src/lib/photos.ts` and credited under the scene on the page. Dirt effects are drawn over them in the browser; the
files are unmodified. Two are from Maryland's Eastern Shore (Meredith House, Cambridge; Lednum House, Easton).

To add a house, save a 1280px-wide photo in `static/photos/`, then add an entry to `houses` with its story count
and each window's rectangle in image pixels.

## Deliberately left out

Accounts, online payments, a live availability calendar, the washer app, recurring plans,
service worker / offline mode / push, and reviews. See the prototype spec.

When it's time for offline support, add `@vite-pwa/sveltekit` to generate a service worker.
